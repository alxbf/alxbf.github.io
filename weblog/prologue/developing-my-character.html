  <h1 align="center">Developing My Character</h1><hr />
  <p>I plan to become the person who I wanted to be which will take 10 years to finish. I want to be the person who is proficient in a lot of skills, having a positive mindset, outlook in life, being able to socialize with a lot of people and being physically fit.</p>
  
  <p>Today, while I have an interest to do this goal and a lot of curiousity, I have problems like: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>As I am a 4th year student not following the K-12 curriculum, I am having trouble learning subjects because I only realized the value of learning last year and I've only got this far with passing grades.</li>
    <li>I'm only 45% good at talking to people, I'm somewhat socially awkward and being bullied because of being too nice. This doesn't mean I don't have friends though.</li>
    <li>I am not physically fit, but I am not really fat.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>While I have problems in life, I also have successes in life like:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>I'm not negative about life, I am positive that I'll be able to live a life without having the three problems mentioned above. I have a positive attitude and personality which makes me easier to approach and talk to people who take me seriously.</li>
    <li>I'm good at computers -- which is a benefit that will help me carry out this goal.</li>
    <li>Ever since last year, I have an interest to learn and a will to change in order to achieve this goal.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In order to start this goal, I'll learn all the required topics everyone should learn in the English Language (grammar, literature, and speech), Mathematics, Science, Technology and Engineering -- which are the subjects/courses which I'll be focusing most on. There are also subjects like Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health (MAPEH) and Technology and Livelihood Education to build necessary skills needed to survive and succeed in life. My religion is Catholic so it's a must for me to read the Holy Bible before I die.</p>
  
  <p>I'll sign up in IRCs to communicate with people in real time to train my speaking skills and to express myself freely without doubts.</p>
  
  <p>I've yet to know what I should do to become physically healthy, I'll find a way to solve that problem.</p>
